## Hello, I'm Vasu a Web-Developer from India.

Mostly doing my work in JavaScript using frameworks like React, Svelte, Qwik, Solid and libraries within the JavaScript ecosystem. I believe in the power of open source collaboration and actively contribute to open source projects whenever possible.

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge and skills by learning Rust, a systems programming language known for its performance, safety, and concurrency features.
